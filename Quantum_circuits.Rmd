# Introduction to Quantum Gates

In quantum computing a quantum logic gate is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits.
A qubit is useless unless it is used to carry out a quantum calculation. The quantum calculations are achieved by performing a series of fundamental operations, known as quantum logic gates. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits similar to the classical logic gates in conventional digital circuits.

$$\newcommand{\ket}[1]{\left|{#1}\right\rangle}$$$$\newcommand{\bra}[1]{\left\langle{#1}\right|}$$$$\newcommand{\braket}[2]{\left\langle{#1}\middle|{#2}\right\rangle}$$
The whole purpose of this site is to not only understand the theoretical aspect of quantum computing but also to understand the concepts quantum gates by programming it. 
The best program that comes to my mind is python's **qiskit**. 
Unfortunately, this is a Rmarkdown file commonly used in R environment. But on the brighter side R has a library called __reticulate__, which helps me to write python code in Rmarkdown file.

## Installation of required libraries.
This code chunk is exclusive for R. The __reticulate__ library helps to code python in R environment.
I have also set the path of the virtual environment __r-reticulate__having all my python libraries.
```{r R libraries}
library(reticulate)

use_python("C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\R-MINI~1\\envs\\r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
```

To install __qiskit__ library, 
```{python, include = FALSE, echo =FALSE, eval = F}
pip install qiskit
```
I am also using the library __qiskit_textbook__ so the output of the matrices renders in $LaTeX$ format.
```{python python libraries}
from qiskit import *
from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_multivector, visualize_transition
from qiskit_textbook.tools import array_to_latex
```

# Single Qubit Gates

There are some important $2\times2$ matrices, which important to understand the basics of quantum gates. Just to work with them, lets start with the most simplest of all,

### Indentity matrix or I-gate

The matrix is $I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Just as a revision, $\ket{0} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\ket{1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Note that these are called **computational bases** and they obey **Orthonormality**. 

Now, lets give $\ket{0}$ through I-gate,

$I\ket{0} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \ket{0}$

Do try the same for $\ket{1}$.

### X-gate (Quantum Not)
Now lets simulate using qiskit.

```{python, echo = FALSE}
# Allowing to create a 1 qubit. By default |0> is used. 
q = QuanutmRegis
qc = QuantumCircuit(1) 
# Putting |0> through X-gate
qc.x(0)
# Circuit diagram
qc.draw('mpl')
```
```{python, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, fig.show = 'hide'}
# To 
visualize_transition(qc,trace = True, saveas = "xgate.gif", fpg = 100, spg = 2)
```

```{python, echo = FALSE}

qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.x(0)
qc.draw('mpl')
```
```{python, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, fig.show = 'hide'}
visualize_transition(qc,trace = True, saveas = "xgate.gif", fpg = 100, spg = 2)
